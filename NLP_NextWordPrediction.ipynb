            "“Alas, no, my lord!” replied D'Artagnan, surprised.\n",
            "“You are discreet--so much the better. I speak of that adventure in behalf  of the  queen,  of  the \n",

            "Come, let us see what you will do for me.”\n",
            "“Everything  that  your  eminence  may  please  to  command  me,”  was  the reply.\n",

            "“Certainly,”  D'Artagnan said to himself, “he wishes to make me speak out. He's not more cunning \n",
            "than De Richelieu was! Devil take him!” Then he said aloud:\n",
            "“The queen, my lord? I don't comprehend.”\n",

            "“Well,  sir,”  returned  Mazarin,  “prudence  is  a  fine  thing,  but  to-day  you might regret \n",
            "having been too prudent.”\n",
            "“My  lord,  Pythagoras  made  his  disciples  keep  silence  for  five  years  that they might \n",

            "“Well,” returned Mazarin, “we will satisfy you.”\n",

            "to  defend  no  one  but  myself,  and  I  shall  defend  myself vigorously, I give you warning.”\n",
            "“Very well,” said the voice; “go away from here and leave the place to us.”\n",
            "“Go  away from  here!”  said  D'Artagnan,  whose  purposes  were  in conflict with that order, \n",
            "“that is not so easy, since I am on the point of  falling, and my horse,  too,  through  fatigue;  \n",
            "unless,  indeed,  you  are  disposed  to  offer  me  a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.”\n",
            "“Rascal!”\n",
            "“Eh!  monsieur!”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  beg  you  will  have  a  care  what  you say;  for  if  \n",
            "you  utter  another  word  like  that,  be  you  marquis,  duke,  prince  or king, I will thrust it \n",
            "down your throat! do you hear?”\n",
            "“Well,  well,”  rejoined  the  leader,  “there's  no  doubt  ‘tis  a  Gascon  who  is speaking,  \n",
            "and  therefore  not the  man  we are looking  for.  Our  blow has failed for  to-night;  let  us  \n",
            "withdraw.  We  shall  meet  again,   Master   d'Artagnan,” continued the leader, raising his voice.\n",
            "“Yes,  but never with the same advantages,”  said D'Artagnan,  in a tone  of raillery; “for when \n",
            "you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight.”\n",
            "“Very good, very good,” said the voice. “En route, gentlemen.”\n",
            "And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared  in the darkness and took the road  to  Paris.  \n",
            "D'Artagnan  and  Planchet  remained  for  some  moments  still  on the  defensive;  then,  as  the  \n",
            "noise  of  the  horsemen  became  more  and  more distant, they sheathed their swords.\n",
            "“Thou seest, simpleton,” said D'Artagnan  to his servant,  “that they wished no harm to us.”\n",
            "“But to whom, then?”\n",
            "“I'faith!  I  neither  know  nor  care. What  I do care for  now,  is to make  my way  into  the  \n",
            "Jesuits'  convent;  so  to  horse  and  let  us  knock  at  their  door. Happen what will, the \n",
            "devil take them, they can't eat us.”\n",
            "And  he  mounted  his  horse.  Planchet  had  just  done  the  same  when  an unexpected weight \n",
            "fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.\n",
            "“Hey! your honor!” cried Planchet, “I've a man behind me.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's\n",
            "\n",
            "horse.\n",
            "“‘Tis  then  the  devil  that   pursues!”   he  cried;   drawing   his  sword  and preparing to \n",
            "attack the new foe.\n",
            "“No, no, dear D'Anagnan,” said the figure, “‘tis not the devil, ‘tis Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, \n",
            "and when you come to the end of  the village turn swiftly to the left.”\n",
            "And  Planchet,  with Aramis  behind  him, set off  at full gallop,  followed  by D'Artagnan,  who \n",
            "began to think he was in the merry  maze  of  some  fantastic dream.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "9. The Abbe D'Herblay.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the extremity  of  the village  Planchet  turned  to the left in obedience  to the orders of  \n",
            "Aramis,  and stopped  underneath  the window  which  had light in it.  Aramis   alighted   and  \n",
            "clapped   his  hands   three   times.   Immediately   the window was opened and a ladder of rope \n",
            "was let down from it.\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  “if  you  like  to  ascend  I  shall  be  delighted  to receive you.”\n",
            "“Ah,” said D'Artagnan, “is that the way you return to your apartment?” “After nine at night, \n",
            "pardieu!” said Aramis, “the rule of the convent is very\n",
            "severe.”\n",
            "“Pardon   me,   my   dear   friend,”   said   D'Artagnan,   “I   think   you   said ‘pardieu!”’\n",
            "“Do you think so?” said Aramis, smiling; “it is possible. You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one \n",
            "acquires bad habits in these cursed convents, or what evil ways all these  men  of  the  church  \n",
            "have,  with whom  I am obliged  to live. But will you not go up?”\n",
            "“Pass on before me, I beg of you.”\n",
            "“As  the  late  cardinal  used  to  say  to  the  late  king,  ‘only  to  show  you  the way, \n",
            "sire.”’ And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant.\n",
            "D'Artagnan  followed,  but  less  nimbly,  showing  plainly  that  this  mode  of ascent was not \n",
            "one to which he was accustomed.\n",
            "“I  beg  your  pardon,”  said  Aramis,  noticing  his  awkwardness;  “if  I  had known  that  I was \n",
            " to have  the  honor  of  your  visit  I should  have  procured  the\n",
            "\n",
            "gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.”\n",
            "“Sir,” said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan  on the summit of  the ladder, “this way is easy for \n",
            "Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of  necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses \n",
            "cannot mount the ladder.”\n",
            "“Take  them  to  yonder  shed,  my  friend,”  said  Aramis,  pointing  to  a  low building on the \n",
            "plain; “there you will find hay and straw for them; then come back  here  and  clap  your  hands  \n",
            "three  times,  and  we  will  give  you  wine  and food. Marry, forsooth, people don't die of \n",
            "hunger here.”\n",
            "And  Aramis,  drawing  in  the  ladder,  closed  the  window.  D'Artagnan  then looked around \n",
            "attentively.\n",
            "Never  was  there  an  apartment  at  the  same  time  more  warlike  and  more elegant. At each \n",
            "corner  were arranged  trophies,  presenting  to view swords  of all  sorts,  and  on  the  walls  \n",
            "hung  four  great  pictures  representing  in  their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de \n",
            "Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the  Cardinal   de  la  Valette,   and  the  Archbishop   of   \n",
            "Bordeaux.   Exteriorly, nothing  in  the  room  showed   that  it  was  the  habitation  of   an  \n",
            "abbe.  The hangings  were of  damask,  the  carpets  from  Alencon,  and  the bed, especially, had \n",
            "more the look of a fine lady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered  \n",
            "counterpane,  than  that  of  a  man  who  had  made  a  vow  that  he would endeavor to gain \n",
            "Heaven by fasting and mortification.\n",
            "“You  are  examining  my  den,”  said  Aramis.  “Ah,  my  dear  fellow,  excuse me; I am lodged \n",
            "like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?”\n",
            "“I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and yet the ladder didn't come \n",
            "down of itself.”\n",
            "“No, it is Bazin.”\n",
            "“Ah! ah!” said D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“But,” continued Aramis, “Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing that I was not alone he \n",
            "discreetly  retired. Sit down,  my dear friend, and let us talk.” And Aramis pushed forward a large \n",
            "easy-chair, in which D'Artagnan stretched himself  out.\n",
            "“In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?” asked Aramis. “Yes,  if   you  really  \n",
            "wish  it,”  said   D'Artagnan,   “and  even  with   great\n",
            "pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.”\n",
            "“Ah, my  poor friend!”  said  Aramis,  “you will find meagre fare;  you were not expected.”\n",
            "“Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Oh, let us hope,” said Aramis, “that with the help of  God and of  Bazin we shall find something  \n",
            "better than that in the larder of  the worthy Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.”\n",
            "The  door  opened  and  Bazin  entered;  on  perceiving   the  musketeer  he uttered an exclamation \n",
            "that was almost a cry of despair.\n",
            "“My  dear  Bazin,”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  am  delighted  to  see  with  what wonderful composure \n",
            "you can tell a lie even in church!”\n",
            "“Sir,” replied Bazin, “I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a \n",
            "falsehood when it is told in a good cause.”\n",
            "“So far well,” said Aramis;  “we are dying of  hunger.  Serve  us up the best supper you can, and \n",
            "especially give us some good wine.”\n",
            "Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.\n",
            "“Now we are alone, dear Aramis,” said D'Artagnan,  “tell me how the devil you managed to alight \n",
            "upon the back of Planchet's horse.”\n",
            "“I'faith!” answered Aramis, “as you see, from Heaven.”\n",
            "“From Heaven,”  replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; “you have no more the appearance of  coming \n",
            "from thence than you have of  going there.”\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  with  a  look  of  imbecility  on  his  face  which D'Artagnan  had \n",
            "never observed whilst he was in the musketeers,  “if  I did not come from Heaven, at least I was \n",
            "leaving Paradise, which is almost the same.”\n",
            "“Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,”  observed D'Artagnan,  “until now they have never been \n",
            "able to agree as to the situation  of  Paradise;  some place it  on  Mount  Ararat,  others  \n",
            "between  the  rivers  Tigris  and  Euphrates;  it seems that  they  have  been  looking  very  far  \n",
            "away  for  it,  while  it  was  actually  very near.  Paradise  is  at  Noisy  Ie  Sec,  upon  the  \n",
            "site  of  the  archbishop's  chateau. People  do  not  go  out  from  it  by  the  door,  but  by  \n",
            "the  window;  one  doesn't descend here by the marble steps of  a peristyle,  but by the branches \n",
            "of  a lime- tree;  and  the  angel  with  a  flaming  sword  who  guards  this  elysium  seems  to \n",
            "have changed  his celestial name of  Gabriel into that of  the more terrestrial one of the Prince \n",
            "de Marsillac.”\n",
            "Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.\n",
            "“You  were  always  a  merry  companion,  my  dear  D'Artagnan,”  he  said, “and your witty Gascon \n",
            "fancy has not deserted you. Yes, there is something in what  you  say;  nevertheless,  do  not  \n",
            "believe  that it is  Madame  de  Longueville with whom I am in love.”\n",
            "“A plague  on't!  I shall  not  do so.  After  having  been  so long in love  with Madame  de  \n",
            "Chevreuse,  you  would  hardly  lay  your  heart  at  the  feet  of  her\n",
            "\n",
            "mortal enemy!”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied  Aramis,  with  an  absent  air;  “yes,  that  poor  duchess!  I  once loved  her  \n",
            "much,  and  to  do  her  justice,  she  was  very  useful  to  us.  Eventually she  was  obliged  \n",
            "to  leave  France.  He  was  a  relentless  enemy,  that  damned cardinal,”  continued  Aramis,  \n",
            "glancing  at  the  portrait  of  the  old minister.  “He had  even  given  orders  to  arrest  her  \n",
            "and  would have  cut  off  her head had  she not escaped with her waiting-maid--poor Kitty! I have \n",
            "heard that she met with a strange adventure  in I don't know what village, with I don't know what \n",
            "cure, of  whom  she  asked  hospitality  and who,  having  but  one  chamber,  and  taking her for \n",
            "a cavalier,  offered to share it with her. For she had a wonderful  way of dressing  as a man,  \n",
            "that  dear Marie; I know only one other woman  who can do it as well.  So they made  this song  \n",
            "about her:  ‘Laboissiere,  dis moi.’ You know it, don't you?”\n",
            "“No, sing it, please.”\n",
            "Aramis immediately complied,  and sang the song in a very lively manner. “Bravo!”  cried  \n",
            "D'Artagnan,  “you  sing  charmingly,  dear  Aramis.  I  do  not\n",
            "perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice.”\n",
            "“My  dear  D'Artagnan,”  replied  Aramis,  “you  understand,  when  I  was  a musketeer I mounted \n",
            "guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbe I say as few masses as I can. But to return to \n",
            "our duchess.”\n",
            "“Which--the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville?”  “Have  I  not  already  told  you \n",
            " that  there  is  nothing  between  me  and  the\n",
            "Duchess de Longueville?  Little  flirtations,  perhaps,  and that's all. No, I spoke\n",
            "of  the Duchess  de Chevreuse;  did  you see  her  after  her return  from  Brussels, after the \n",
            "king's death?”\n",
            "“Yes, she is still beautiful.”\n",
            "“Yes,” said Aramis,  “I  saw her also at that time. I gave her good advice, by which  she  did not  \n",
            "profit.  I  ventured  to  tell  her  that  Mazarin  was  the  lover  of Anne  of  Austria.  She  \n",
            "wouldn't  believe  me,  saying  that  she  knew  Anne  of Austria,  who was too proud  to love  \n",
            "such  a worthless  coxcomb.  After  that  she plunged  into  the  cabal  headed  by  the  Duke  of  \n",
            "Beaufort;  and  the  ‘coxcomb’ arrested De Beaufort  and banished Madame de Chevreuse.”\n",
            "“You  know,”  resumed  D'Artagnan,  “that  she  has  had  leave  to  return  to France?”\n",
            "“Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another.” “Oh, but this time \n",
            "perhaps she will follow your advice.”\n",
            "“Oh,   this   time,”   returned   Aramis,   “I   haven't   seen   her;   she   is   much\n",
            "\n",
            "changed.”\n",
            "“In that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same; you have still your \n",
            "beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure, still your feminine hands, which are admirably \n",
            "suited to a prelate.”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied Aramis, “I am extremely  careful of  my appearance.  Do you know that I am growing \n",
            "old? I am nearly thirty-seven.”\n",
            "“Mind,  Aramis”--D’Artagnan smiled  as  he  spoke--“since  we  are  together again, let us agree on \n",
            "one point: what age shall we be in future?”\n",
            "“How?”\n",
            "“Formerly  I  was  your  junior  by  two  or  three  years,  and  if   I  am  not mistaken I am \n",

            "“Indeed!  Then  ‘tis  I who  am  mistaken,  for  you  have  always  been  a  good chronologist. By \n",
            "your reckoning I must be forty-three at least. The devil I am! Don't let it out at the Hotel \n",
            "Rambouillet; it would ruin me,” replied the abbe.\n",

            "Bazin! Hurry up there, you rascal; we are mad with hunger and thirst!” Bazin entered at that moment \n",

            "feeling, but a sort of  buffoon, a punchinello, a pantaloon. Do you know him? I do not.”\n",
            "“Hem!” said D'Artagnan, “there is some truth in what you say.”\n",

            "“Now  then,”  said  D'Artagnan,  “this  is something  like;  this  is a  means  of communication. A \n",

            "“Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being,” said the servitor,  who,  little  \n",

            "This  voice,  the  sound  of  which  reached  D'Artagnan,  reawakened  in  his heart a thousand \n",
            "sentiments, a thousand  recollections that he had forgotten. He vaulted  hastily  from  his  horse, \n",

            "“What, Planchet, is Monsieur d'Artagnan here?”\n",
            "“Here I am, my friend, dear Athos!”  cried D'Artagnan, in a faltering voice and almost staggering \n",
            "from agitation.\n",
            "At   these   words   a   visible   emotion   was   expressed   on   the   beautiful countenance  \n",
            "and  calm  features  of  Athos.  He  rushed  toward  D'Artagnan  with eyes fixed upon him and \n",
            "clasped him in his arms. D'Artagnan, equally moved, pressed him also closely to him, whilst tears \n",
            "stood in his eyes. Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room,  where there \n",
            "were several people. Every one arose.\n",
            "“I present to you,” he said, “Monsieur le Chevalier  D'Artagnan,  lieutenant of  his  majesty's  \n",
            "musketeers,  a devoted  friend  and  one  of  the  most  excellent, brave gentlemen that I have \n",
            "ever known.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan  received  the  compliments  of  those  who  were  present  in  his own  way,  and  \n",

            "\n",
            "Strange!   Athos   was   scarcely   aged   at   all!   His   fine   eyes,   no   longer surrounded  \n",
            "by that  dark line which  nights of  dissipation  pencil too infallibly, seemed larger, more liquid \n",
            "than ever. His face, a little elongated, had gained in calm   dignity  what  it  had  lost  in  \n",
            "feverish   excitement.   His  hand,   always wonderfully  beautiful  and strong,  was set  off  by \n",
            "a  ruffle  of  lace,  like  certain hands  by Titian  and Vandyck.  He was less stiff  than \n",
            "formerly.  His long, dark hair, softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils, fell elegantly \n",
            "over his shoulders  in  wavy  curls;  his  voice  was  still  youthful,  as  if  belonging  to  a \n",
            "Hercules  of  twenty-five,  and  his  magnificent  teeth,  which  he  had  preserved white and \n",
            "sound, gave an indescribable  charm to his smile.\n",
            "Meanwhile the guests, seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone, prepared  to  depart,  \n",
            "when  a  noise  of   dogs  barking  resounded  through  the courtyard and many persons said at the \n",

            "“Ah! ‘tis Raoul, who is come home.”\n",
            "Athos,  as  the  name  of   Raoul  was  pronounced,  looked  inquisitively   at D'Artagnan,  in  \n",
            "order  to  see  if  any  curiosity  was  painted  on  his  face.  But D'Artagnan  was  still  in  \n",
            "confusion  and  turned  around  almost  mechanically when a fine young  man of  fifteen  years of  \n",
            "age, dressed simply,  but in perfect taste, entered the room, raising, as he came, his hat, adorned \n",
            "with a long plume of scarlet feathers.\n",
            "Nevertheless,   D'Artagnan   was  struck   by  the  appearance   of   this   new personage.  It  \n",
            "seemed  to  explain  to  him  the  change  in  Athos;  a  resemblance between  the  boy  and  the  \n",
            "man  explained   the  mystery  of   this  regenerated existence. He remained listening and gazing.\n",
            "“Here you are, home again, Raoul,” said the comte.\n",
            "“Yes, sir,” replied the youth, with deep respect,  “and I have performed  the commission that you \n",
            "gave me.”\n",
            "“But what's the matter,  Raoul?”  said Athos, very anxiously.  “You  are pale and agitated.”\n",
            "“Sir,”  replied  the  young  man,  “it is on  account  of  an  accident  which  has happened to our \n",
            "little neighbor.”\n",
            "“To Mademoiselle de la Valliere?” asked Athos, quickly. “What is it?” cried many persons present.\n",
            "“She  was  walking  with  her  nurse  Marceline,   in  the  place  where  the woodmen  cut the \n",
            "wood,  when,  passing  on horseback,  I stopped.  She saw me also  and in trying  to  jump  from  \n",
            "the  end  of  a pile  of  wood  on which  she had mounted, the poor child fell and was not able to \n",

            "\n",
            "“Oh,  heavens!”  cried  Athos.  “And  her  mother,  Madame  de  Saint-Remy, have they yet told her \n",
            "of it?”\n",
            "“No, sir, Madame de Saint-Remy is at Blois with the Duchess of  Orleans. I am afraid that what was \n",
            "first done was unskillful,  if  not worse than useless.  I am come, sir, to ask your advice.”\n",
            "“Send directly to Blois,  Raoul; or, rather,  take horse and ride immediately yourself.”\n",
            "Raoul bowed.\n",
            "“But where is Louise?” asked the comte.\n",
            "“I  have  brought  her  here,  sir,  and  I  have  deposited   her  in  charge  of Charlotte,  who, \n",
            " till  better  advice  comes,  has  bathed  the  foot  in  cold  well- water.”\n",
            "The  guests  now all took  leave  of  Athos,  excepting  the  old  Duc  de Barbe, who, as an old \n",

            "his carriage.\n",
            "“You  are  right,  sir,”  said  Athos.  “She will be the sooner  with  her  mother.\n",
            "As for you, Raoul, I am sure it is your fault, some giddiness or folly.” “No, sir, I assure you,” \n",
            "muttered Raoul, “it is not.”\n",
            "“Oh,  no,  no,  I declare  it is not!”  cried the  young  girl, while  Raoul  turned pale at the \n",

            "“Nevertheless,  Raoul,  you  must  go  to  Blois  and  you  must  make  your excuses and mine to \n",

            "composed  of  ten  men,  sallied  forth  from  each  of  the  lanes which encompassed the house and \n",
            "surrounded D'Artagnan and Planchet.\n",
            "“Heyday!”  cried D'Artagnan,  drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his  horse;  “are  you  \n",
            "not  mistaken?  is  it  really  for  us  that  you  mean  your attack?”\n",
            "“Here  he  is!  we  have  him!”  cried  the  horsemen,  rushing  on  D'Artagnan with naked swords.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Don't let him escape!” said a loud voice. “No, my lord; be assured we shall not.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.\n",
            "“Halloo,  gentlemen!”  he  called  out  in  his  Gascon  accent,  “what  do  you want? what do you \n",
            "demand?”\n",
            "“That thou shalt soon know,” shouted a chorus of horsemen.\n",
            "“Stop, stop!” cried he whom they had addressed as “my lord;” “‘tis not his voice.”\n",
            "“Ah!  just so,  gentlemen!  pray,  do  people  get into  a  passion  at  random  at Noisy?  Take  \n",
            "care,  for  I  warn  you  that  the  first  man  that  comes  within  the length of my sword--and \n",
            "my sword is long--I rip him up.”\n",
            "The chieftain of the party drew near.\n",
            "“What  are  you  doing  here?”  he  asked  in  a  lofty  tone,  as  that  of  one accustomed to \n",
            "command.\n",
            "“And you--what are you doing here?” replied D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself, one insists on \n",
            "respect suitable to one's rank.”\n",
            "“You  don't  choose  to  discover  yourself,  because  you  are  the  leader  of  an ambuscade,”   \n",
            "returned   D'Artagnan;   “but   with   regard   to  myself,   who   am traveling  quietly  with  my \n",
            " own  servant,  I  have  not  the  same  reasons  as  you have to conceal my name.”\n",
            "“Enough! enough! what is your name?”\n",
            "“I shall  tell you  my  name in order  that you  may  know  where  to find  me, my lord, or my \n",
            "prince,  as it may suit you best to be called,”  said our Gascon, who  did  not  choose  to  seem  \n",
            "to  yield  to  a  threat.  “Do  you  know  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“Lieutenant  in the king's  musketeers?”  said the voice;  “you  are  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“I am.”\n",
            "“Then you came here to defend him?” “Him? whom?”\n",
            "“The man we are seeking.”\n",
            "“It seems,” said D'Artagnan,  “that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered, without \n",
            "suspecting it, into the kingdom of mysteries.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Come,”  replied  the  same  lofty  tone,  “answer!  Are  you  waiting  for  him underneath these \n",
            "windows? Did you come to Noisy to defend him?”\n",
            "“I am  waiting  for  no one,”  replied  D'Artagnan,  who  was beginning  to be angry.  “I  propose  \n",
            "to  defend  no  one  but  myself,  and  I  shall  defend  myself vigorously, I give you warning.”\n",
            "“Very well,” said the voice; “go away from here and leave the place to us.”\n",
            "“Go  away from  here!”  said  D'Artagnan,  whose  purposes  were  in conflict with that order, \n",
            "“that is not so easy, since I am on the point of  falling, and my horse,  too,  through  fatigue;  \n",
            "unless,  indeed,  you  are  disposed  to  offer  me  a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.”\n",
            "“Rascal!”\n",
            "“Eh!  monsieur!”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  beg  you  will  have  a  care  what  you say;  for  if  \n",
            "you  utter  another  word  like  that,  be  you  marquis,  duke,  prince  or king, I will thrust it \n",
            "down your throat! do you hear?”\n",
            "“Well,  well,”  rejoined  the  leader,  “there's  no  doubt  ‘tis  a  Gascon  who  is speaking,  \n",
            "and  therefore  not the  man  we are looking  for.  Our  blow has failed for  to-night;  let  us  \n",
            "withdraw.  We  shall  meet  again,   Master   d'Artagnan,” continued the leader, raising his voice.\n",
            "“Yes,  but never with the same advantages,”  said D'Artagnan,  in a tone  of raillery; “for when \n",
            "you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight.”\n",
            "“Very good, very good,” said the voice. “En route, gentlemen.”\n",
            "And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared  in the darkness and took the road  to  Paris.  \n",
            "D'Artagnan  and  Planchet  remained  for  some  moments  still  on the  defensive;  then,  as  the  \n",
            "noise  of  the  horsemen  became  more  and  more distant, they sheathed their swords.\n",
            "“Thou seest, simpleton,” said D'Artagnan  to his servant,  “that they wished no harm to us.”\n",
            "“But to whom, then?”\n",
            "“I'faith!  I  neither  know  nor  care. What  I do care for  now,  is to make  my way  into  the  \n",
            "Jesuits'  convent;  so  to  horse  and  let  us  knock  at  their  door. Happen what will, the \n",
            "devil take them, they can't eat us.”\n",
            "And  he  mounted  his  horse.  Planchet  had  just  done  the  same  when  an unexpected weight \n",
            "fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.\n",
            "“Hey! your honor!” cried Planchet, “I've a man behind me.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's\n",

            "horse.\n",
            "“‘Tis  then  the  devil  that   pursues!”   he  cried;   drawing   his  sword  and preparing to \n",
            "attack the new foe.\n",
            "“No, no, dear D'Anagnan,” said the figure, “‘tis not the devil, ‘tis Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, \n",
            "and when you come to the end of  the village turn swiftly to the left.”\n",
            "And  Planchet,  with Aramis  behind  him, set off  at full gallop,  followed  by D'Artagnan,  who \n",
            "began to think he was in the merry  maze  of  some  fantastic dream.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "9. The Abbe D'Herblay.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the extremity  of  the village  Planchet  turned  to the left in obedience  to the orders of  \n",
            "Aramis,  and stopped  underneath  the window  which  had light in it.  Aramis   alighted   and  \n",
            "clapped   his  hands   three   times.   Immediately   the window was opened and a ladder of rope \n",
            "was let down from it.\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  “if  you  like  to  ascend  I  shall  be  delighted  to receive you.”\n",
            "“Ah,” said D'Artagnan, “is that the way you return to your apartment?” “After nine at night, \n",
            "pardieu!” said Aramis, “the rule of the convent is very\n",
            "severe.”\n",
            "“Pardon   me,   my   dear   friend,”   said   D'Artagnan,   “I   think   you   said ‘pardieu!”’\n",
            "“Do you think so?” said Aramis, smiling; “it is possible. You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one \n",
            "acquires bad habits in these cursed convents, or what evil ways all these  men  of  the  church  \n",
            "have,  with whom  I am obliged  to live. But will you not go up?”\n",
            "“Pass on before me, I beg of you.”\n",
            "“As  the  late  cardinal  used  to  say  to  the  late  king,  ‘only  to  show  you  the way, \n",
            "sire.”’ And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant.\n",
            "D'Artagnan  followed,  but  less  nimbly,  showing  plainly  that  this  mode  of ascent was not \n",
            "one to which he was accustomed.\n",
            "“I  beg  your  pardon,”  said  Aramis,  noticing  his  awkwardness;  “if  I  had known  that  I was \n",
            " to have  the  honor  of  your  visit  I should  have  procured  the\n",
            "\n",
            "gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.”\n",
            "“Sir,” said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan  on the summit of  the ladder, “this way is easy for \n",
            "Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of  necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses \n",
            "cannot mount the ladder.”\n",
            "“Take  them  to  yonder  shed,  my  friend,”  said  Aramis,  pointing  to  a  low building on the \n",
            "plain; “there you will find hay and straw for them; then come back  here  and  clap  your  hands  \n",
            "three  times,  and  we  will  give  you  wine  and food. Marry, forsooth, people don't die of \n",
            "hunger here.”\n",
            "And  Aramis,  drawing  in  the  ladder,  closed  the  window.  D'Artagnan  then looked around \n",
            "attentively.\n",
            "Never  was  there  an  apartment  at  the  same  time  more  warlike  and  more elegant. At each \n",
            "corner  were arranged  trophies,  presenting  to view swords  of all  sorts,  and  on  the  walls  \n",
            "hung  four  great  pictures  representing  in  their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de \n",
            "Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the  Cardinal   de  la  Valette,   and  the  Archbishop   of   \n",
            "Bordeaux.   Exteriorly, nothing  in  the  room  showed   that  it  was  the  habitation  of   an  \n",
            "abbe.  The hangings  were of  damask,  the  carpets  from  Alencon,  and  the bed, especially, had \n",
            "more the look of a fine lady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered  \n",
            "counterpane,  than  that  of  a  man  who  had  made  a  vow  that  he would endeavor to gain \n",
            "Heaven by fasting and mortification.\n",
            "“You  are  examining  my  den,”  said  Aramis.  “Ah,  my  dear  fellow,  excuse me; I am lodged \n",
            "like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?”\n",
            "“I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and yet the ladder didn't come \n",
            "down of itself.”\n",
            "“No, it is Bazin.”\n",
            "“Ah! ah!” said D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“But,” continued Aramis, “Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing that I was not alone he \n",
            "discreetly  retired. Sit down,  my dear friend, and let us talk.” And Aramis pushed forward a large \n",
            "easy-chair, in which D'Artagnan stretched himself  out.\n",
            "“In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?” asked Aramis. “Yes,  if   you  really  \n",
            "wish  it,”  said   D'Artagnan,   “and  even  with   great\n",
            "pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.”\n",
            "“Ah, my  poor friend!”  said  Aramis,  “you will find meagre fare;  you were not expected.”\n",
            "“Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Oh, let us hope,” said Aramis, “that with the help of  God and of  Bazin we shall find something  \n",
            "better than that in the larder of  the worthy Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.”\n",
            "The  door  opened  and  Bazin  entered;  on  perceiving   the  musketeer  he uttered an exclamation \n",
            "that was almost a cry of despair.\n",
            "“My  dear  Bazin,”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  am  delighted  to  see  with  what wonderful composure \n",
            "you can tell a lie even in church!”\n",
            "“Sir,” replied Bazin, “I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a \n",
            "falsehood when it is told in a good cause.”\n",
            "“So far well,” said Aramis;  “we are dying of  hunger.  Serve  us up the best supper you can, and \n",
            "especially give us some good wine.”\n",
            "Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.\n",
            "“Now we are alone, dear Aramis,” said D'Artagnan,  “tell me how the devil you managed to alight \n",
            "upon the back of Planchet's horse.”\n",
            "“I'faith!” answered Aramis, “as you see, from Heaven.”\n",
            "“From Heaven,”  replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; “you have no more the appearance of  coming \n",
            "from thence than you have of  going there.”\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  with  a  look  of  imbecility  on  his  face  which D'Artagnan  had \n",
            "never observed whilst he was in the musketeers,  “if  I did not come from Heaven, at least I was \n",
            "leaving Paradise, which is almost the same.”\n",
            "“Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,”  observed D'Artagnan,  “until now they have never been \n",
            "able to agree as to the situation  of  Paradise;  some place it  on  Mount  Ararat,  others  \n",
            "between  the  rivers  Tigris  and  Euphrates;  it seems that  they  have  been  looking  very  far  \n",
            "away  for  it,  while  it  was  actually  very near.  Paradise  is  at  Noisy  Ie  Sec,  upon  the  \n",
            "site  of  the  archbishop's  chateau. People  do  not  go  out  from  it  by  the  door,  but  by  \n",
            "the  window;  one  doesn't descend here by the marble steps of  a peristyle,  but by the branches \n",
            "of  a lime- tree;  and  the  angel  with  a  flaming  sword  who  guards  this  elysium  seems  to \n",
            "have changed  his celestial name of  Gabriel into that of  the more terrestrial one of the Prince \n",
            "de Marsillac.”\n",
            "Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.\n",
            "“You  were  always  a  merry  companion,  my  dear  D'Artagnan,”  he  said, “and your witty Gascon \n",
            "fancy has not deserted you. Yes, there is something in what  you  say;  nevertheless,  do  not  \n",
            "believe  that it is  Madame  de  Longueville with whom I am in love.”\n",
            "“A plague  on't!  I shall  not  do so.  After  having  been  so long in love  with Madame  de  \n",
            "Chevreuse,  you  would  hardly  lay  your  heart  at  the  feet  of  her\n",
            "\n",
            "mortal enemy!”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied  Aramis,  with  an  absent  air;  “yes,  that  poor  duchess!  I  once loved  her  \n",
            "much,  and  to  do  her  justice,  she  was  very  useful  to  us.  Eventually she  was  obliged  \n",
            "to  leave  France.  He  was  a  relentless  enemy,  that  damned cardinal,”  continued  Aramis,  \n",
            "glancing  at  the  portrait  of  the  old minister.  “He had  even  given  orders  to  arrest  her  \n",
            "and  would have  cut  off  her head had  she not escaped with her waiting-maid--poor Kitty! I have \n",
            "heard that she met with a strange adventure  in I don't know what village, with I don't know what \n",
            "cure, of  whom  she  asked  hospitality  and who,  having  but  one  chamber,  and  taking her for \n",
            "a cavalier,  offered to share it with her. For she had a wonderful  way of dressing  as a man,  \n",
            "that  dear Marie; I know only one other woman  who can do it as well.  So they made  this song  \n",
            "about her:  ‘Laboissiere,  dis moi.’ You know it, don't you?”\n",
            "“No, sing it, please.”\n",
            "Aramis immediately complied,  and sang the song in a very lively manner. “Bravo!”  cried  \n",
            "D'Artagnan,  “you  sing  charmingly,  dear  Aramis.  I  do  not\n",
            "perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice.”\n",
            "“My  dear  D'Artagnan,”  replied  Aramis,  “you  understand,  when  I  was  a musketeer I mounted \n",
            "guard as seldom as I could; now when I am an abbe I say as few masses as I can. But to return to \n",
            "our duchess.”\n",
            "“Which--the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville?”  “Have  I  not  already  told  you \n",
            " that  there  is  nothing  between  me  and  the\n",
            "Duchess de Longueville?  Little  flirtations,  perhaps,  and that's all. No, I spoke\n",
            "of  the Duchess  de Chevreuse;  did  you see  her  after  her return  from  Brussels, after the \n",
            "king's death?”\n",
            "“Yes, she is still beautiful.”\n",
            "“Yes,” said Aramis,  “I  saw her also at that time. I gave her good advice, by which  she  did not  \n",
            "profit.  I  ventured  to  tell  her  that  Mazarin  was  the  lover  of Anne  of  Austria.  She  \n",
            "wouldn't  believe  me,  saying  that  she  knew  Anne  of Austria,  who was too proud  to love  \n",
            "such  a worthless  coxcomb.  After  that  she plunged  into  the  cabal  headed  by  the  Duke  of  \n",
            "Beaufort;  and  the  ‘coxcomb’ arrested De Beaufort  and banished Madame de Chevreuse.”\n",
            "“You  know,”  resumed  D'Artagnan,  “that  she  has  had  leave  to  return  to France?”\n",
            "“Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another.” “Oh, but this time \n",
            "perhaps she will follow your advice.”\n",
            "“Oh,   this   time,”   returned   Aramis,   “I   haven't   seen   her;   she   is   much\n",
            "\n",
            "changed.”\n",
            "“In that respect unlike you, my dear Aramis, for you are still the same; you have still your \n",
            "beautiful dark hair, still your elegant figure, still your feminine hands, which are admirably \n",
            "suited to a prelate.”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied Aramis, “I am extremely  careful of  my appearance.  Do you know that I am growing \n",

            "a  ruffle  of  lace,  like  certain hands  by Titian  and Vandyck.  He was less stiff  than \n",
            "formerly.  His long, dark hair, softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils, fell elegantly \n",

            "“Well, we won't speak of it any more, then;” and Planchet took his place in D’Artagnan’s  suite  \n",
            "with  that  sublime  confidence  he  had  always  had  in  his master, which even fifteen years of \n",
            "separation had not destroyed.\n",
            "They had traveled  onward about  half  a mile when Planchet came close up to D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“Stop,  sir,  look  yonder,”  he  whispered;  “don't  you  see  in  the  darkness something pass \n",
            "by, like shadows? I fancy I hear horses' feet.”\n",
            "“Impossible!”  returned  D'Artagnan.  “The  ground  is  soaking  wet;  yet  I fancy, as thou \n",
            "sayest, that I see something.”\n",
            "At  this  moment  the  neighing  of  a  horse  struck  his  ear,  coming  through darkness and \n",
            "space.\n",
            "“There are men somewhere about, but that's of  no consequence to us,” said D'Artagnan; “let us ride \n",
            "onward.”\n",
            "At  about  half-past  eight  o'clock  they  reached  the  first  houses  in  Noisy;\n",
            "\n",
            "every  one  was  in  bed  and  not  a  light  was  to  be  seen  in  the  village.  The obscurity \n",
            "was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses.  Here  and  there  a \n",
            " dog  barked  behind  a  door  or  an  affrighted  cat  fled precipitately  from  the  midst  of  \n",
            "the  pavement  to take  refuge  behind  a  pile  of faggots,  from  which  retreat  her  eyes  \n",
            "would  shine  like  peridores.  These  were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the \n",
            "village.\n",
            "Toward the middle of the town, commanding the principal open space, rose a   dark   mass,   \n",
            "separated   from   the   rest   of   the   world   by   two   lanes   and overshadowed   in   the   \n",
            "front   by   enormous   lime-trees.   D'Artagnan   looked attentively at the building.\n",
            "“This,”  he said  to Planchet,  “must  be the  archbishop's  chateau,  the  abode of the fair \n",
            "Madame de Longueville; but the convent, where is that?”\n",
            "“The  convent,  your  honor,  is  at  the  other  end  of  the  village;  I  know  it well.”\n",
            "“Well, then, Planchet,  gallop up to it whilst I tighten  my horse's girth, and come back and tell \n",
            "me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits' windows.”\n",
            "In about five minutes Planchet returned.\n",
            "“Sir,” he said, “there is one window of the convent lighted up.”\n",
            "“Hem! If  I were a ‘Frondeur,”’ said D'Artagnan,  “I should knock here and should be sure of  a \n",
            "good supper. If  I were a monk I should  knock yonder  and should have a good supper  there, too; \n",
            "whereas, ‘tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds, \n",
            "dying with hunger and thirst.”\n",
            "“Yes,” added Planchet, “like the famous ass of Buridan. Shall I knock?” “Hush!”   replied   \n",
            "D'Artagnan;   “the   light   no   longer   burns   in   yonder\n",
            "window.”\n",
            "“Do you hear nothing?” whispered Planchet. “What is that noise?”\n",
            "There  came  a  sound  like  a  whirlwind,  at  the  same  time  two  troops  of horsemen,  each  \n",
            "composed  of  ten  men,  sallied  forth  from  each  of  the  lanes which encompassed the house and \n",
            "surrounded D'Artagnan and Planchet.\n",
            "“Heyday!”  cried D'Artagnan,  drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his  horse;  “are  you  \n",
            "not  mistaken?  is  it  really  for  us  that  you  mean  your attack?”\n",
            "“Here  he  is!  we  have  him!”  cried  the  horsemen,  rushing  on  D'Artagnan with naked swords.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Don't let him escape!” said a loud voice. “No, my lord; be assured we shall not.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.\n",
            "“Halloo,  gentlemen!”  he  called  out  in  his  Gascon  accent,  “what  do  you want? what do you \n",
            "demand?”\n",
            "“That thou shalt soon know,” shouted a chorus of horsemen.\n",
            "“Stop, stop!” cried he whom they had addressed as “my lord;” “‘tis not his voice.”\n",
            "“Ah!  just so,  gentlemen!  pray,  do  people  get into  a  passion  at  random  at Noisy?  Take  \n",
            "care,  for  I  warn  you  that  the  first  man  that  comes  within  the length of my sword--and \n",
            "my sword is long--I rip him up.”\n",
            "The chieftain of the party drew near.\n",
            "“What  are  you  doing  here?”  he  asked  in  a  lofty  tone,  as  that  of  one accustomed to \n",
            "command.\n",
            "“And you--what are you doing here?” replied D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself, one insists on \n",
            "respect suitable to one's rank.”\n",
            "“You  don't  choose  to  discover  yourself,  because  you  are  the  leader  of  an ambuscade,”   \n",
            "returned   D'Artagnan;   “but   with   regard   to  myself,   who   am traveling  quietly  with  my \n",
            " own  servant,  I  have  not  the  same  reasons  as  you have to conceal my name.”\n",
            "“Enough! enough! what is your name?”\n",
            "“I shall  tell you  my  name in order  that you  may  know  where  to find  me, my lord, or my \n",
            "prince,  as it may suit you best to be called,”  said our Gascon, who  did  not  choose  to  seem  \n",
            "to  yield  to  a  threat.  “Do  you  know  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“Lieutenant  in the king's  musketeers?”  said the voice;  “you  are  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“I am.”\n",
            "“Then you came here to defend him?” “Him? whom?”\n",
            "“The man we are seeking.”\n",
            "“It seems,” said D'Artagnan,  “that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered, without \n",
            "suspecting it, into the kingdom of mysteries.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Come,”  replied  the  same  lofty  tone,  “answer!  Are  you  waiting  for  him underneath these \n",
            "windows? Did you come to Noisy to defend him?”\n",
            "“I am  waiting  for  no one,”  replied  D'Artagnan,  who  was beginning  to be angry.  “I  propose  \n",
            "to  defend  no  one  but  myself,  and  I  shall  defend  myself vigorously, I give you warning.”\n",
            "“Very well,” said the voice; “go away from here and leave the place to us.”\n",
            "“Go  away from  here!”  said  D'Artagnan,  whose  purposes  were  in conflict with that order, \n",
            "“that is not so easy, since I am on the point of  falling, and my horse,  too,  through  fatigue;  \n",
            "unless,  indeed,  you  are  disposed  to  offer  me  a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.”\n",
            "“Rascal!”\n",
            "“Eh!  monsieur!”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  beg  you  will  have  a  care  what  you say;  for  if  \n",
            "you  utter  another  word  like  that,  be  you  marquis,  duke,  prince  or king, I will thrust it \n",
            "down your throat! do you hear?”\n",
            "“Well,  well,”  rejoined  the  leader,  “there's  no  doubt  ‘tis  a  Gascon  who  is speaking,  \n",
            "and  therefore  not the  man  we are looking  for.  Our  blow has failed for  to-night;  let  us  \n",
            "withdraw.  We  shall  meet  again,   Master   d'Artagnan,” continued the leader, raising his voice.\n",
            "“Yes,  but never with the same advantages,”  said D'Artagnan,  in a tone  of raillery; “for when \n",
            "you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight.”\n",
            "“Very good, very good,” said the voice. “En route, gentlemen.”\n",
            "And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared  in the darkness and took the road  to  Paris.  \n",
            "D'Artagnan  and  Planchet  remained  for  some  moments  still  on the  defensive;  then,  as  the  \n",
            "noise  of  the  horsemen  became  more  and  more distant, they sheathed their swords.\n",
            "“Thou seest, simpleton,” said D'Artagnan  to his servant,  “that they wished no harm to us.”\n",
            "“But to whom, then?”\n",
            "“I'faith!  I  neither  know  nor  care. What  I do care for  now,  is to make  my way  into  the  \n",
            "Jesuits'  convent;  so  to  horse  and  let  us  knock  at  their  door. Happen what will, the \n",
            "devil take them, they can't eat us.”\n",
            "And  he  mounted  his  horse.  Planchet  had  just  done  the  same  when  an unexpected weight \n",
            "fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.\n",
            "“Hey! your honor!” cried Planchet, “I've a man behind me.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's\n",
            "\n",
            "horse.\n",
            "“‘Tis  then  the  devil  that   pursues!”   he  cried;   drawing   his  sword  and preparing to \n",
            "attack the new foe.\n",
            "“No, no, dear D'Anagnan,” said the figure, “‘tis not the devil, ‘tis Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, \n",
            "and when you come to the end of  the village turn swiftly to the left.”\n",
            "And  Planchet,  with Aramis  behind  him, set off  at full gallop,  followed  by D'Artagnan,  who \n",
            "began to think he was in the merry  maze  of  some  fantastic dream.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "9. The Abbe D'Herblay.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the extremity  of  the village  Planchet  turned  to the left in obedience  to the orders of  \n",
            "Aramis,  and stopped  underneath  the window  which  had light in it.  Aramis   alighted   and  \n",
            "clapped   his  hands   three   times.   Immediately   the window was opened and a ladder of rope \n",
            "was let down from it.\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  “if  you  like  to  ascend  I  shall  be  delighted  to receive you.”\n",
            "“Ah,” said D'Artagnan, “is that the way you return to your apartment?” “After nine at night, \n",
            "pardieu!” said Aramis, “the rule of the convent is very\n",
            "severe.”\n",
            "“Pardon   me,   my   dear   friend,”   said   D'Artagnan,   “I   think   you   said ‘pardieu!”’\n",
            "“Do you think so?” said Aramis, smiling; “it is possible. You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one \n",
            "acquires bad habits in these cursed convents, or what evil ways all these  men  of  the  church  \n",
            "have,  with whom  I am obliged  to live. But will you not go up?”\n",
            "“Pass on before me, I beg of you.”\n",
            "“As  the  late  cardinal  used  to  say  to  the  late  king,  ‘only  to  show  you  the way, \n",
            "sire.”’ And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant.\n",
            "D'Artagnan  followed,  but  less  nimbly,  showing  plainly  that  this  mode  of ascent was not \n",
            "one to which he was accustomed.\n",
            "“I  beg  your  pardon,”  said  Aramis,  noticing  his  awkwardness;  “if  I  had known  that  I was \n",
            " to have  the  honor  of  your  visit  I should  have  procured  the\n",
            "\n",
            "gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.”\n",
            "“Sir,” said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan  on the summit of  the ladder, “this way is easy for \n",
            "Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of  necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses \n",
            "cannot mount the ladder.”\n",
            "“Take  them  to  yonder  shed,  my  friend,”  said  Aramis,  pointing  to  a  low building on the \n",
            "plain; “there you will find hay and straw for them; then come back  here  and  clap  your  hands  \n",
            "three  times,  and  we  will  give  you  wine  and food. Marry, forsooth, people don't die of \n",
            "hunger here.”\n",
            "And  Aramis,  drawing  in  the  ladder,  closed  the  window.  D'Artagnan  then looked around \n",
            "attentively.\n",
            "Never  was  there  an  apartment  at  the  same  time  more  warlike  and  more elegant. At each \n",
            "corner  were arranged  trophies,  presenting  to view swords  of all  sorts,  and  on  the  walls  \n",
            "hung  four  great  pictures  representing  in  their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de \n",
            "Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the  Cardinal   de  la  Valette,   and  the  Archbishop   of   \n",
            "Bordeaux.   Exteriorly, nothing  in  the  room  showed   that  it  was  the  habitation  of   an  \n",
            "abbe.  The hangings  were of  damask,  the  carpets  from  Alencon,  and  the bed, especially, had \n",
            "more the look of a fine lady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered  \n",
            "counterpane,  than  that  of  a  man  who  had  made  a  vow  that  he would endeavor to gain \n",
            "Heaven by fasting and mortification.\n",
            "“You  are  examining  my  den,”  said  Aramis.  “Ah,  my  dear  fellow,  excuse me; I am lodged \n",
            "like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?”\n",
            "“I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and yet the ladder didn't come \n",
            "down of itself.”\n",
            "“No, it is Bazin.”\n",
            "“Ah! ah!” said D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“But,” continued Aramis, “Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing that I was not alone he \n",
            "discreetly  retired. Sit down,  my dear friend, and let us talk.” And Aramis pushed forward a large \n",
            "easy-chair, in which D'Artagnan stretched himself  out.\n",
            "“In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?” asked Aramis. “Yes,  if   you  really  \n",
            "wish  it,”  said   D'Artagnan,   “and  even  with   great\n",
            "pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.”\n",
            "“Ah, my  poor friend!”  said  Aramis,  “you will find meagre fare;  you were not expected.”\n",
            "“Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Oh, let us hope,” said Aramis, “that with the help of  God and of  Bazin we shall find something  \n",
            "better than that in the larder of  the worthy Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.”\n",
            "The  door  opened  and  Bazin  entered;  on  perceiving   the  musketeer  he uttered an exclamation \n",
            "that was almost a cry of despair.\n",
            "“My  dear  Bazin,”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  am  delighted  to  see  with  what wonderful composure \n",
            "you can tell a lie even in church!”\n",
            "“Sir,” replied Bazin, “I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a \n",
            "falsehood when it is told in a good cause.”\n",
            "“So far well,” said Aramis;  “we are dying of  hunger.  Serve  us up the best supper you can, and \n",
            "especially give us some good wine.”\n",
            "Bazin bowed low, sighed, and left the room.\n",
            "“Now we are alone, dear Aramis,” said D'Artagnan,  “tell me how the devil you managed to alight \n",
            "upon the back of Planchet's horse.”\n",
            "“I'faith!” answered Aramis, “as you see, from Heaven.”\n",
            "“From Heaven,”  replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; “you have no more the appearance of  coming \n",
            "from thence than you have of  going there.”\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  with  a  look  of  imbecility  on  his  face  which D'Artagnan  had \n",
            "never observed whilst he was in the musketeers,  “if  I did not come from Heaven, at least I was \n",
            "leaving Paradise, which is almost the same.”\n",
            "“Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,”  observed D'Artagnan,  “until now they have never been \n",
            "able to agree as to the situation  of  Paradise;  some place it  on  Mount  Ararat,  others  \n",
            "between  the  rivers  Tigris  and  Euphrates;  it seems that  they  have  been  looking  very  far  \n",
            "away  for  it,  while  it  was  actually  very near.  Paradise  is  at  Noisy  Ie  Sec,  upon  the  \n",
            "site  of  the  archbishop's  chateau. People  do  not  go  out  from  it  by  the  door,  but  by  \n",
            "the  window;  one  doesn't descend here by the marble steps of  a peristyle,  but by the branches \n",
            "of  a lime- tree;  and  the  angel  with  a  flaming  sword  who  guards  this  elysium  seems  to \n",
            "have changed  his celestial name of  Gabriel into that of  the more terrestrial one of the Prince \n",
            "de Marsillac.”\n",
            "Aramis burst into a fit of laughter.\n",
            "“You  were  always  a  merry  companion,  my  dear  D'Artagnan,”  he  said, “and your witty Gascon \n",
            "fancy has not deserted you. Yes, there is something in what  you  say;  nevertheless,  do  not  \n",
            "believe  that it is  Madame  de  Longueville with whom I am in love.”\n",
            "“A plague  on't!  I shall  not  do so.  After  having  been  so long in love  with Madame  de  \n",
            "Chevreuse,  you  would  hardly  lay  your  heart  at  the  feet  of  her\n",
            "\n",
            "mortal enemy!”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied  Aramis,  with  an  absent  air;  “yes,  that  poor  duchess!  I  once loved  her  \n",
            "much,  and  to  do  her  justice,  she  was  very  useful  to  us.  Eventually she  was  obliged  \n",
            "to  leave  France.  He  was  a  relentless  enemy,  that  damned cardinal,”  continued  Aramis,  \n",
            "glancing  at  the  portrait  of  the  old minister.  “He had  even  given  orders  to  arrest  her  \n",

            "“‘Tis true; man, as you know,” said Aramis, “is a strange animal, made up of contradictions. Since \n",

            "“That  is  apparent  in  your  surroundings;  you  have  rapiers  here  of  every form and to suit \n",

            "“Sir,  my instinct told  me that those people were assembled  there for some bad  purpose;  and  I  \n",
            "was  reflecting  on  what  my  instinct  had  told  me,  in  the darkest corner  of  the stable, \n",
            "when a man wrapped  in a cloak and followed  by two other men, came in.”\n",
            "“Ah   ah!”   said   D'Artagnan,   Planchet's   recital   agreeing   with   his  own observations.  \n",
            "“Well?”\n",
            "“One of  these two men said, ‘He must certainly be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening, for I \n",

            "“‘Art thou sure?’ said the man in the cloak. “‘Yes, my prince.”’\n",

            "“Yes,  ‘my  prince;’  but  listen.  ‘If  he  is  here’--this  is  what  the  other  man \n",
            "said--‘let us see decidedly what to do with him.’\n",
            "“‘What to do with him?’ answered the prince.\n",
            "“‘Yes,  he is  not  a  man  to  allow  himself  to  be  taken  anyhow;  he will  defend himself.’\n",
            "“‘Well, we must try to take him alive. Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his \n",

            "“’We have.’\n",
            "“‘Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman.’ “‘Yes, yes, my lord; do not be \n",

            "“Well, what matters all that to us?” said D'Artagnan.  “This is one of  those attempts that happen \n",
            "every day.”\n",
            "“Are you sure that we are not its objects?” “We? Why?”\n",
            "“Just remember what they said. ‘I have seen his servant,  said one, and that applies very well to \n",

            "“Well?”\n",
            "“‘He must certainly  be at Noisy, or be coming there this evening,  said the other; and that \n",
            "applies very well to you.”\n",
            "“What else?”\n",
            "“Then  the  prince  said:  ‘Take  notice  that  in  all  probability  he  will  be disguised as a \n",
            "cavalier;  which seems to me to leave no room for doubt, since you  are dressed  as a cavalier  and \n",
            " not  as an  officer  of  musketeers.  Now  then, what do you say to that?”\n",
            "“Alas! my dear Planchet,”  said D'Anagnan,  sighing, “we are unfortunately no longer in those times \n",
            "in which princes would care to assassinate  me. Those were good old days; never fear--these people \n",
            "owe us no grudge.”\n",

            "“I can answer for it they do not.”\n",
            "“Well, we will not speak of it any more, then;” and Planchet took his place in D’Artagnan’s  suite  \n",
            "with  that  sublime  confidence  he  had  always  had  in  his master, which even fifteen years of \n",
            "separation had not destroyed.\n",
            "They had traveled  onward about  half  a mile when Planchet came close up to D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“Stop,  sir,  look  yonder,”  he  whispered;  “do not  you  see  in  the  darkness something pass \n",
            "by, like shadows? I fancy I hear horses' feet.”\n",
            "“Impossible!”  returned  D'Artagnan.  “The  ground  is  soaking  wet;  yet  I fancy, as thou \n",
            "sayest, that I see something.”\n",
            "At  this  moment  the  neighing  of  a  horse  struck  his  ear,  coming  through darkness and \n",
            "space.\n",
            "“There are men somewhere about, but that is of  no consequence to us,” said D'Artagnan; “let us ride \n",
            "onward.”\n",
            "At  about  half-past  eight  of the clock  they  reached  the  first  houses  in  Noisy;\n",
            "\n",
            "every  one  was  in  bed  and  not  a  light  was  to  be  seen  in  the  village.  The obscurity \n",
            "was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses.  Here  and  there  a \n",
            " dog  barked  behind  a  door  or  an  affrighted  cat  fled precipitately  from  the  midst  of  \n",
            "the  pavement  to take  refuge  behind  a  pile  of faggots,  from  which  retreat  her  eyes  \n",
            "would  shine  like  peridores.  These  were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the \n",
            "village.\n",
            "Toward the middle of the town, commanding the principal open space, rose a   dark   mass,   \n",
            "separated   from   the   rest   of   the   world   by   two   lanes   and overshadowed   in   the   \n",
            "front   by   enormous   lime-trees.   D'Artagnan   looked attentively at the building.\n",
            "“This,”  he said  to Planchet,  “must  be the  archbishop's  chateau,  the  abode of the fair \n",
            "Madame de Longueville; but the convent, where is that?”\n",
            "“The  convent,  your  honor,  is  at  the  other  end  of  the  village;  I  know  it well.”\n",
            "“Well, then, Planchet,  gallop up to it whilst I tighten  my horse's girth, and come back and tell \n",
            "me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits' windows.”\n",
            "In about five minutes Planchet returned.\n",
            "“Sir,” he said, “there is one window of the convent lighted up.”\n",
            "“Hem! If  I were a ‘Frondeur,”’ said D'Artagnan,  “I should knock here and should be sure of  a \n",
            "good supper. If  I were a monk I should  knock yonder  and should have a good supper  there, too; \n",
            "whereas, ‘it is very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds, \n",
            "dying with hunger and thirst.”\n",
            "“Yes,” added Planchet, “like the famous ass of Buridan. Shall I knock?” “Hush!”   replied   \n",
            "D'Artagnan;   “the   light   no   longer   burns   in   yonder\n",
            "window.”\n",
            "“Do you hear nothing?” whispered Planchet. “What is that noise?”\n",
            "There  came  a  sound  like  a  whirlwind,  at  the  same  time  two  troops  of horsemen,  each  \n",
            "composed  of  ten  men,  sallied  forth  from  each  of  the  lanes which encompassed the house and \n",
            "surrounded D'Artagnan and Planchet.\n",
            "“Heyday!”  cried D'Artagnan,  drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his  horse;  “are  you  \n",
            "not  mistaken?  is  it  really  for  us  that  you  mean  your attack?”\n",
            "“Here  he  is!  we  have  him!”  cried  the  horsemen,  rushing  on  D'Artagnan with naked swords.\n",
            "\n",
            "“do not let him escape!” said a loud voice. “No, my lord; be assured we shall not.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation.\n",
            "“Halloo,  gentlemen!”  he  called  out  in  his  Gascon  accent,  “what  do  you want? what do you \n",
            "demand?”\n",
            "“That thou shalt soon know,” shouted a chorus of horsemen.\n",
            "“Stop, stop!” cried he whom they had addressed as “my lord;” “‘it is not his voice.”\n",
            "“Ah!  just so,  gentlemen!  pray,  do  people  get into  a  passion  at  random  at Noisy?  Take  \n",
            "care,  for  I  warn  you  that  the  first  man  that  comes  within  the length of my sword--and \n",
            "my sword is long--I rip him up.”\n",
            "The chieftain of the party drew near.\n",
            "“What  are  you  doing  here?”  he  asked  in  a  lofty  tone,  as  that  of  one accustomed to \n",
            "command.\n",
            "“And you--what are you doing here?” replied D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“Be civil, or I shall beat you; for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself, one insists on \n",
            "respect suitable to one's rank.”\n",
            "“You  do not  choose  to  discover  yourself,  because  you  are  the  leader  of  an ambuscade,”   \n",
            "returned   D'Artagnan;   “but   with   regard   to  myself,   who   am traveling  quietly  with  my \n",
            " own  servant,  I  have  not  the  same  reasons  as  you have to conceal my name.”\n",
            "“Enough! enough! what is your name?”\n",
            "“I shall  tell you  my  name in order  that you  may  know  where  to find  me, my lord, or my \n",
            "prince,  as it may suit you best to be called,”  said our Gascon, who  did  not  choose  to  seem  \n",
            "to  yield  to  a  threat.  “Do  you  know  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“Lieutenant  in the king's  musketeers?”  said the voice;  “you  are  Monsieur d'Artagnan?”\n",
            "“I am.”\n",
            "“Then you came here to defend him?” “Him? whom?”\n",
            "“The man we are seeking.”\n",
            "“It seems,” said D'Artagnan,  “that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered, without \n",
            "suspecting it, into the kingdom of mysteries.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Come,”  replied  the  same  lofty  tone,  “answer!  Are  you  waiting  for  him underneath these \n",
            "windows? Did you come to Noisy to defend him?”\n",
            "“I am  waiting  for  no one,”  replied  D'Artagnan,  who  was beginning  to be angry.  “I  propose  \n",
            "to  defend  no  one  but  myself,  and  I  shall  defend  myself vigorously, I give you warning.”\n",
            "“Very well,” said the voice; “go away from here and leave the place to us.”\n",
            "“Go  away from  here!”  said  D'Artagnan,  whose  purposes  were  in conflict with that order, \n",
            "“that is not so easy, since I am on the point of  falling, and my horse,  too,  through  fatigue;  \n",
            "unless,  indeed,  you  are  disposed  to  offer  me  a supper and a bed in the neighborhood.”\n",
            "“Rascal!”\n",
            "“Eh!  monsieur!”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  beg  you  will  have  a  care  what  you say;  for  if  \n",
            "you  utter  another  word  like  that,  be  you  marquis,  duke,  prince  or king, I will thrust it \n",
            "down your throat! do you hear?”\n",
            "“Well,  well,”  rejoined  the  leader,  “there is  no  doubt  ‘it is  a  Gascon  who  is speaking,  \n",
            "and  therefore  not the  man  we are looking  for.  Our  blow has failed for  to-night;  let  us  \n",
            "withdraw.  We  shall  meet  again,   Master   d'Artagnan,” continued the leader, raising his voice.\n",
            "“Yes,  but never with the same advantages,”  said D'Artagnan,  in a tone  of raillery; “for when \n",
            "you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight.”\n",
            "“Very good, very good,” said the voice. “En route, gentlemen.”\n",
            "And the troop, grumbling angrily, disappeared  in the darkness and took the road  to  Paris.  \n",
            "D'Artagnan  and  Planchet  remained  for  some  moments  still  on the  defensive;  then,  as  the  \n",
            "noise  of  the  horsemen  became  more  and  more distant, they sheathed their swords.\n",
            "“Thou seest, simpleton,” said D'Artagnan  to his servant,  “that they wished no harm to us.”\n",
            "“But to whom, then?”\n",
            "“I'faith!  I  neither  know  nor  care. What  I do care for  now,  is to make  my way  into  the  \n",
            "Jesuits'  convent;  so  to  horse  and  let  us  knock  at  their  door. Happen what will, the \n",
            "devil take them, they cannot eat us.”\n",
            "And  he  mounted  his  horse.  Planchet  had  just  done  the  same  when  an unexpected weight \n",
            "fell upon the back of the horse, which sank down.\n",
            "“Hey! your honor!” cried Planchet, “I have a man behind me.”\n",
            "D'Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet's\n",

            "horse.\n",
            "“‘it is  then  the  devil  that   pursues!”   he  cried;   drawing   his  sword  and preparing to \n",
            "attack the new foe.\n",
            "“No, no, dear D'Anagnan,” said the figure, “‘it is not the devil, ‘it is Aramis; gallop fast, Planchet, \n",
            "and when you come to the end of  the village turn swiftly to the left.”\n",
            "And  Planchet,  with Aramis  behind  him, set off  at full gallop,  followed  by D'Artagnan,  who \n",
            "began to think he was in the merry  maze  of  some  fantastic dream.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            ". The Abbe D'Herblay.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the extremity  of  the village  Planchet  turned  to the left in obedience  to the orders of  \n",
            "Aramis,  and stopped  underneath  the window  which  had light in it.  Aramis   alighted   and  \n",
            "clapped   his  hands   three   times.   Immediately   the window was opened and a ladder of rope \n",
            "was let down from it.\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  “if  you  like  to  ascend  I  shall  be  delighted  to receive you.”\n",
            "“Ah,” said D'Artagnan, “is that the way you return to your apartment?” “After nine at night, \n",
            "pardieu!” said Aramis, “the rule of the convent is very\n",
            "severe.”\n",
            "“Pardon   me,   my   dear   friend,”   said   D'Artagnan,   “I   think   you   said ‘pardieu!”’\n",
            "“Do you think so?” said Aramis, smiling; “it is possible. You have no idea, my dear fellow, how one \n",
            "acquires bad habits in these cursed convents, or what evil ways all these  men  of  the  church  \n",
            "have,  with whom  I am obliged  to live. But will you not go up?”\n",
            "“Pass on before me, I beg of you.”\n",
            "“As  the  late  cardinal  used  to  say  to  the  late  king,  ‘only  to  show  you  the way, \n",
            "sire.”’ And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant.\n",
            "D'Artagnan  followed,  but  less  nimbly,  showing  plainly  that  this  mode  of ascent was not \n",
            "one to which he was accustomed.\n",
            "“I  beg  your  pardon,”  said  Aramis,  noticing  his  awkwardness;  “if  I  had known  that  I was \n",
            " to have  the  honor  of  your  visit  I should  have  procured  the\n",
            "\n",
            "gardener's ladder; but for me alone this is good enough.”\n",
            "“Sir,” said Planchet when he saw D'Artagnan  on the summit of  the ladder, “this way is easy for \n",
            "Monsieur Aramis and even for you; in case of  necessity I might also climb up, but my two horses \n",
            "cannot mount the ladder.”\n",
            "“Take  them  to  yonder  she would,  my  friend,”  said  Aramis,  pointing  to  a  low building on the \n",
            "plain; “there you will find hay and straw for them; then come back  here  and  clap  your  hands  \n",
            "three  times,  and  we  will  give  you  wine  and food. Marry, forsooth, people do not die of \n",
            "hunger here.”\n",
            "And  Aramis,  drawing  in  the  ladder,  closed  the  window.  D'Artagnan  then looked around \n",
            "attentively.\n",
            "Never  was  there  an  apartment  at  the  same  time  more  warlike  and  more elegant. At each \n",
            "corner  were arranged  trophies,  presenting  to view swords  of all  sorts,  and  on  the  walls  \n",
            "hung  four  great  pictures  representing  in  their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de \n",
            "Lorraine, the Cardinal de Richelieu, the  Cardinal   de  la  Valette,   and  the  Archbishop   of   \n",
            "Bordeaux.   Exteriorly, nothing  in  the  room  showed   that  it  was  the  habitation  of   an  \n",
            "abbe.  The hangings  were of  damask,  the  carpets  from  Alencon,  and  the bed, especially, had \n",
            "more the look of a fine lady's couch, with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered  \n",
            "counterpane,  than  that  of  a  man  who  had  made  a  vow  that  he would endeavor to gain \n",
            "Heaven by fasting and mortification.\n",
            "“You  are  examining  my  den,”  said  Aramis.  “Ah,  my  dear  fellow,  excuse me; I am lodged \n",
            "like a Chartreux. But what are you looking for?”\n",
            "“I am looking for the person who let down the ladder. I see no one and yet the ladder did not come \n",
            "down of itself.”\n",
            "“No, it is Bazin.”\n",
            "“Ah! ah!” said D'Artagnan.\n",
            "“But,” continued Aramis, “Bazin is a well trained servant, and seeing that I was not alone he \n",
            "discreetly  retired. Sit down,  my dear friend, and let us talk.” And Aramis pushed forward a large \n",
            "easy-chair, in which D'Artagnan stretched himself  out.\n",
            "“In the first place, you will sup with me, will you not?” asked Aramis. “Yes,  if   you  really  \n",
            "wish  it,”  said   D'Artagnan,   “and  even  with   great\n",
            "pleasure, I confess; the journey has given me a devil of an appetite.”\n",
            "“Ah, my  poor friend!”  said  Aramis,  “you will find meagre fare;  you were not expected.”\n",
            "“Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur?”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Oh, let us hope,” said Aramis, “that with the help of  God and of  Bazin we shall find something  \n",
            "better than that in the larder of  the worthy Jesuit fathers. Bazin, my friend, come here.”\n",
            "The  door  opened  and  Bazin  entered;  on  perceiving   the  musketeer  he uttered an exclamation \n",
            "that was almost a cry of despair.\n",
            "“My  dear  Bazin,”  said  D'Artagnan,  “I  am  delighted  to  see  with  what wonderful composure \n",
            "you can tell a lie even in church!”\n",

            "falsehood when it is told in a good because.”\n",
            "“So far well,” said Aramis;  “we are dying of  hunger.  Serve  us up the best supper you can, and \n",

            "“I'faith!” answered Aramis, “as you see, from Heaven.”\n",
            "“From Heaven,”  replied D'Artagnan, shaking his head; “you have no more the appearance of  coming \n",
            "from thence than you have of  going there.”\n",
            "“My  friend,”  said  Aramis,  with  a  look  of  imbecility  on  his  face  which D'Artagnan  had \n",
            "never observed whilst he was in the musketeers,  “if  I did not come from Heaven, at least I was \n",

            "“Here, then, is a puzzle for the learned,”  observed D'Artagnan,  “until now they have never been \n",
            "able to agree as to the situation  of  Paradise;  some place it  on  Mount  Ararat,  others  \n",
            "between  the  rivers  Tigris  and  Euphrates;  it seems that  they  have  been  looking  very  far  \n",
            "away  for  it,  while  it  was  actually  very near.  Paradise  is  at  Noisy  Ie  Sec,  upon  the  \n",
            "site  of  the  archbishop's  chateau. People  do  not  go  out  from  it  by  the  door,  but  by  \n",
            "the  window;  one  does not descend here by the marble steps of  a peristyle,  but by the branches \n",
            "of  a lime- tree;  and  the  angel  with  a  flaming  sword  who  guards  this  elysium  seems  to \n",

            "mortal enemy!”\n",
            "“Yes,”  replied  Aramis,  with  an  absent  air;  “yes,  that  poor  duchess!  I  once loved  her  \n",
            "much,  and  to  do  her  justice,  she  was  very  useful  to  us.  Eventually she  was  obliged  \n",
            "to  leave  France.  He  was  a  relentless  enemy,  that  damned cardinal,”  continued  Aramis,  \n",
            "glancing  at  the  portrait  of  the  old minister.  “He had  even  given  orders  to  arrest  her  \n",

            "that  dear Marie; I know only one other woman  who can do it as well.  So they made  this song  \n",

            "“No, sing it, please.”\n",
            "Aramis immediately complied,  and sang the song in a very lively manner. “Bravo!”  cried  \n",

            "“Yes, she is still beautiful.”\n",
            "“Yes,” said Aramis,  “I  saw her also at that time. I gave her good advice, by which  she  did not  \n",
            "profit.  I  ventured  to  tell  her  that  Mazarin  was  the  lover  of Anne  of  Austria.  She  \n",
            "would not  believe  me,  saying  that  she  knew  Anne  of Austria,  who was too proud  to love  \n",
            "such  a worthless  coxcomb.  After  that  she plunged  into  the  cabal  headed  by  the  Duke  of  \n",
            "Beaufort;  and  the  ‘coxcomb’ arrested De Beaufort  and banished Madame de Chevreuse.”\n",
